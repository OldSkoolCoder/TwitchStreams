## Twitch Stream Tutorials

These tutorials are based around libraries to allow the "noob" coder to get there head around tricky topics of the C64.

These topics are :
* Sprites
* CharPad and Tile Maps
* Sprite Multiplexing
* Screen Smooth Scrolling Left and Right
* Adding screen animation while the screen scrolls
* Added Quazzy and Jill to the screen, so Quazzy can move around and Jill stays with the scenery
* Added New Map and re-wrote the code to use the more sophisticated sprite library for when we use the multiplexor

All these libraries are free to use, for all you budding C64 game developers.

Enjoy
